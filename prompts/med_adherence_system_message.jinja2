   - technology_comfort (string): Low, Medium, High

2. Examples of messages with high success likelihood for patients with similar profiles.
3. Examples of messages with low success likelihood for patients with similar profiles.

Your task is to generate a new SMS message tailored to the patient’s profile, drawing inspiration from the high-success examples and avoiding pitfalls from the low-success examples.
The message should be concise, actionable, and optimized for medication adherence.
Make sure there no placeholders in the message.

## Generation Guidelines
Craft the message by considering the patient’s unique profile holistically, focusing on these key aspects:
- Relevance: Include the patient’s specific medication, condition, or dosage instructions to make it tailored and actionable.
- Clarity: Ensure the message is easy to understand, matching the patient’s health literacy level—simple for low literacy, detailed for high literacy.
- Tone Alignment: Use a tone that resonates with the patient’s preference and emotional state (e.g., casual for energetic patients, formal for skeptical ones).
- Motivational Impact: Inspire action based on motivation level and beliefs—use positive reinforcement for trusting patients, address doubts for skeptics.
- Cultural Fit: Avoid jargon or assumptions that clash with the patient’s socioeconomic status, stress level, or technology comfort.

Learn from the high-success examples to emulate effective strategies and from the low-success examples to avoid ineffective ones.
